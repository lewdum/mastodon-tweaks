A Firefox extension for tweaking Mastodon's web client UI.

Now compatible with all Mastodon instances, at least in theory.


## Implemented tweaks

- **Custom "Publish" label**: Finally, you can get back your beloved "Toots"!

- **Move sidebar to the left**: Places the timeline sidebar on the left on smaller devices.


## Policies

No telemetry, no ads, no bullshit.


## How to install

Currently, this extension is not on the official Firefox Addons (AMO) repository.

As such, the easiest way to install it is to download a built/signed artifact manually.

1. Download the .xpi file from the [latest release] (this is currently marked as a pre-release version).

1. Go to the "Add-ons and themes" screen on Firefox by either clicking the "hamburguer" menu on the top right, or using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+A</kbd> (by default).

1. Click the "gear" menu on the right and select "Install Add-on From File...". From there, just pick the .xpi file you download in step 1 and confirm installation.
